The absence of a tailored heart disease prediction model for medical professionals poses a critical challenge in proactive cardiac care. Current diagnostic methods lack a comprehensive tool that leverages crucial data inputs like age, gender, blood pressure, sex, and diabetes status to accurately assess cardiovascular risk. This deficiency inhibits early identification and preventive measures, impacting patient outcomes and healthcare efficacy. The pressing need for a sophisticated predictive model capable of evaluating and forecasting heart disease risk based on diverse factors underscores a crucial gap in the medical domain, urging the development of precise risk assessment tools for improved patient care and disease management.  



PROPOSED SOLUTION
The solution lies in the development of a comprehensive heart disease prediction model tailored explicitly for medical professionals. This model will integrate an array of diverse data inputs—gender, age, blood pressure (BP), sex, and diabetes status—to accurately evaluate and identify individuals at risk of cardiovascular disorders. By amalgamating these critical factors into a predictive algorithm, the model will empower doctors with a precise tool to assess and predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients. This predictive model aims to revolutionize cardiac care by offering an efficient and proactive approach to risk assessment. It will enable healthcare practitioners to stratify patients based on their unique risk profiles, facilitating early interventions, personalized treatment strategies, and preventive measures. By leveraging advanced analytical techniques, this model will serve as a crucial decision support system, aiding doctors in making informed clinical decisions, optimizing patient care, and ultimately improving cardiovascular health outcomes. Its implementation holds the promise of transforming the landscape of cardiac care, ushering in a new era of proactive and personalized healthcare practices.



 
TECHNICAL  REQUIREMENTS

   Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gather a diverse dataset including gender, education levels, area of stay, family size, number of children, previous loan statuses, and credit histories. Handle missing values, outliers, and ensure data consistency and quality. 
   Feature Engineering: Create relevant features from the collected data, like categorical encoding for gender and education, normalization for numerical features, and possibly feature scaling. 
  Data Splitting: Divide the dataset into training, validation, and test sets for model training and evaluation. 
  Model Selection: Choose logistic regression as the baseline model due to its interpretability and suitability for binary classification tasks. 
  Model Training: Train the logistic regression model on the training dataset using relevant libraries like scikit-learn or TensorFlow. 
  Model Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC on the validation set. 
  Feature Importance Analysis: Analyze feature importance to understand which variables significantly influence the model's predictions. 
  Model Deployment and Testing: Once satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it to predict loan sanctioning on new data. Test its robustness and generalizability on the test dataset.
  Data Visualization and Representation using PowerBI: Power Bi is used to build an interactive dashboard.
